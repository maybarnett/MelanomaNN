 # Automated Melanoma Diagnosis using a Convolutional Neural Network

 ## Disclaimer
**Important**: This neural network model is intended for research and educational purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Skin cancer diagnosis is a complex medical procedure that requires expertise and thorough examination by qualified healthcare professionals.
While this project strives for accuracy, it is not a replacement for a doctor's visit. If you suspect any skin abnormalities or have concerns about your health, please consult a medical professional promptly.

## Project Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify skin cancer as either malignant or benign based on image data. Skin cancer is a critical health concern, and early detection is vital for effective treatment. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to assist medical professionals in diagnosing skin cancer more accurately and efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is organized into two main folders:
- **train**: This folder contains a large collection of images used for training the skin cancer classification model.
- **test**: The 'test' folder holds a separate set of images used for evaluating the model's performance. These images are not used during the training process and serve as an independent validation dataset.

## Current Project Status
This project is currently in its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, with a focus on refining and optimizing its functionality. Key project details:
- **Machine Learning Model**: The skin cancer classification model has been developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically leveraging the ResNet architecture for efficient image processing.
- **Accuracy**: As of the current state, the model has achieved an accuracy rate of 83% on the provided dataset, demonstrating promising results in the classification of malignant and benign skin cancer.
- **Ongoing Optimization**: The project is actively evolving, with ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the model. This includes code optimizations, fine-tuning of hyperparameters, and potential data augmentation techniques.
