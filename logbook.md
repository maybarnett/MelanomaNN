- I had my CNN output a confusion matrix. This matrix serves as a visual representation, providing a breakdown of the data used in the training versus the data subjected to testing. It also aids in comprehending the performance of my model, further enhancing the interpretability of the results and the functionality of the CNN

- I had my CNN output a figure that displays the specific process that the CNN uses to analyse and defines the parameters and dimensions of images going through the deep learning model. The figure shows 15 images that were put into the training set of the model.

- I reviewed multiple websites that showcased different diagrams to represent CNNs or DCNs. I chose to include this diagram for my science fair paper, partly because it is a simply picture that represents how the model processes data; found at https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mostly-complete-chart-of-neural-networks-explained-3fb6f2367464
